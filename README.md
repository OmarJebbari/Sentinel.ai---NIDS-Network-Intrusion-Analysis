## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying network threats using the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**. By combining traditional Machine Learning (SVM, Decision Trees) with an AI-driven interactive interface, we provide a deep dive into network security patterns.

### 🚀 Features
* **Interactive AI Analysis:** Real-time insights into attack categories.
* **Model Performance:** Comparison of Supervised vs. Unsupervised models.
* **Data Mining:** Full preprocessing of 82,332 training samples.

### 👥 The Team
* **Omar Jebbari** & The Project Sentinel Team
* **Supervised by:** Prof. Anass Belcaid
